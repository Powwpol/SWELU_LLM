Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its extensive standard library and rich ecosystem of third-party packages make it popular for web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects containing data and methods. Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects with shared attributes and behaviors.

Functions are fundamental building blocks that encapsulate reusable logic. They accept input parameters, perform computations, and return results. Higher-order functions can take other functions as arguments or return functions, enabling powerful abstractions.

Data structures determine how data is organized and accessed. Arrays provide contiguous memory storage with constant-time indexing. Linked lists use nodes with pointers, enabling efficient insertions and deletions. Hash tables offer average-case constant-time lookups using hash functions.

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. Binary search trees maintain sorted data for efficient searching. Balanced trees like AVL and Red-Black trees guarantee logarithmic height. Heaps provide efficient priority queue operations.

Graphs consist of vertices connected by edges, representing relationships between entities. Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and depth-first search solve fundamental problems in network analysis, routing, and social network analysis.

Algorithm complexity is analyzed using Big O notation, which describes how runtime or space requirements grow with input size. Common complexities include O(1) constant time, O(log n) logarithmic, O(n) linear, O(n log n) linearithmic, and O(n²) quadratic.

Recursion is a technique where functions call themselves to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems. Base cases prevent infinite recursion, while recursive cases reduce the problem size. Dynamic programming optimizes recursive solutions by caching results.

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order. Quick sort and merge sort achieve O(n log n) average-case complexity. Bubble sort and insertion sort are simpler but less efficient at O(n²). Radix sort can achieve linear time for integers.

Database systems manage persistent data storage and retrieval. Relational databases organize data in tables with relationships defined by foreign keys. SQL provides a declarative language for querying and manipulating data. NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas for unstructured data.

Concurrency enables multiple tasks to execute simultaneously. Threads share memory within a process, while processes have isolated memory spaces. Synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources.

Version control systems like Git track changes to code over time. Branches allow parallel development, while commits create snapshots of the codebase. Merging integrates changes from different branches, and conflict resolution handles overlapping modifications.

API design principles include consistency, simplicity, and proper error handling. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods for CRUD operations, while GraphQL provides flexible querying. Authentication and rate limiting protect against unauthorized access and abuse.

Testing ensures code correctness and reliability. Unit tests verify individual components, integration tests check interactions between modules, and end-to-end tests validate complete workflows. Test-driven development writes tests before implementation code.

Software architecture patterns provide proven solutions for organizing code. MVC separates concerns into models, views, and controllers. Microservices decompose applications into independently deployable services. Event-driven architectures enable loose coupling through asynchronous messaging.

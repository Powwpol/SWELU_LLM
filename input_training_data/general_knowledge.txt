The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to harbor life. It has a layered structure consisting of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, protects life from harmful radiation and regulates temperature.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Using chlorophyll, they capture sunlight and combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. This process forms the foundation of most food chains on Earth.

The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. Evaporation transforms liquid water into vapor, condensation forms clouds, precipitation returns water to the surface, and runoff channels water into oceans and rivers.

Genetics is the study of heredity and variation in living organisms. DNA, a double-helix molecule, contains genetic information encoded in sequences of nucleotide bases. Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins, determining traits passed from parents to offspring.

Evolution by natural selection explains how species change over time. Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits to subsequent generations. Over millions of years, this process leads to the diversity of life observed today.

The human body consists of multiple interconnected systems. The circulatory system transports oxygen and nutrients through blood vessels. The respiratory system exchanges gases through the lungs. The nervous system coordinates responses using electrical signals. The digestive system breaks down food to extract energy.

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of bonds between atoms. Exothermic reactions release energy, while endothermic reactions absorb energy. Catalysts accelerate reactions without being consumed, and equilibrium represents a balance between forward and reverse reactions.

The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number and chemical properties. Elements in the same group share similar characteristics due to their electron configurations. Metals, nonmetals, and metalloids exhibit distinct physical and chemical properties.

Energy exists in various forms including kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, and nuclear. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Efficiency measures how much useful work is obtained from energy input.

Electricity flows through conductors when electrons move in response to an electric field. Voltage represents electrical potential difference, current measures the flow rate of charge, and resistance opposes current flow. Ohm's law relates these quantities: voltage equals current times resistance.

Waves are disturbances that propagate through space and time, transferring energy. Mechanical waves require a medium, while electromagnetic waves can travel through vacuum. Wave properties include wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed. Interference occurs when waves overlap.

The universe originated approximately 13.8 billion years ago in an event called the Big Bang. It has been expanding ever since, with galaxies moving away from each other. The universe contains ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy, each playing crucial roles in cosmic evolution.

Stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. Nuclear fusion in their cores converts hydrogen to helium, releasing enormous energy. Stars evolve through stages depending on their mass, eventually becoming white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.

Climate refers to long-term weather patterns in a region, influenced by factors like latitude, altitude, ocean currents, and atmospheric circulation. Climate change describes significant alterations to global or regional climate patterns, currently accelerated by human activities.

Ecosystems consist of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Energy flows through trophic levels from producers to consumers to decomposers. Biogeochemical cycles circulate essential elements like carbon, nitrogen, and water through biotic and abiotic components.

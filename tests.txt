   - Modèle: MambaSWELU (124,104,719 paramètres)
   - Checkpoint: Step 757,500
   - Device: cuda
   - Tests réalisés: 5

💡 Observations:
   - Le modèle génère du texte de manière fluide
   - La cohérence varie selon le prompt et la température
   - Température basse (0.3-0.5) = plus déterministe
   - Température haute (0.8-1.0) = plus créatif

🔧 Pour usage interactif:
   - Créez un wrapper web (Gradio/Streamlit)
   - Ajustez les prompts pour votre cas d'usage
   - Fine-tunez si besoin sur des données spécifiques
